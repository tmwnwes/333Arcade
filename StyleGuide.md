*Please Review and make alterations/suggetsions as you see fit*

Functions should have comment blocks directly above or docstrings inside, explaining what their purose is as well as their general expected input(s) and output(s)

All shapes directly created prior to runtime must be named
Simple variables and low-scope variables should be one descriptive noun 
Global variables or wide-scope or app-wide variables should be camelCase and descriptive
Lists/Arrays should be pluralized nouns describing what will be in them
Functions should be snake_case verb or verb phrase with the above mentioned comment block
More complex variables like classes/groups/shapes should be camelCase with an explanatory comment at declaration
Field access should be one descriptive adjective or noun, and be camelCase when one word is not enough


If there are many variables/shapes/lists being declared right next to eachother at once, i.e. a bunch of related terms for a math equation, all of the body parts for hangman, different lists of strings/ints, then a single comment explaining what they are and how they are related shall be sufficient instead of making a comment for each one.
