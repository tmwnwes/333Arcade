# 333Arcade
 Repository for COMP333 Fall Semester Project


**Python 3.14 is not currently supported. Please use Python 3.9 - 3.13**

 In order to run the launcher in its current state, the cmu_graphics folder must be in the same directory as the launcher. For convenienvce, it is included in the repository

 Addititionally, since the games were built upon the cmu_graphics library, they must also be in the same directory to run.

 Finally, since we are using a graphics library, we are reliant on its update schedule. For now, it is up to date with Python 3.13.9.

 Any later versions will not work with this project. Confer with this document for any updates on that.
