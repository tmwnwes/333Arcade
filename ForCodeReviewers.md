For members of the code review team, this document and the README.md documents are necessary to read

All instructions for setup are included in the README.

Extra steps:

Run the launcher and all games in full screen mode, they will not function properly otherwise

Since you are specifically doing code review, please follow all of the steps in README and then launch PretendLauncher.py

This file serves as our current (and very crude) launcher for this project. Interact with the program as you would any game launcher. 

There is a slider at the bottom to navigate to extra games (assuming there are more than 4 .py game files when you use this program)

3 games at the time of code review are ready to use. These are part of the project, so please click on their button in the launcher and test them out as well. I will also include extra .py files in the release that will just run a few lines of code to show that they work. Test all of these if able. 

You may run into security issues on macOS (and the instructions to solve this problem are included in the README, so please read it all the way through)

Game specific help:

SubGame: Move with WASD, shoot with left and right arrows, Pause and Unpause with p. Play another round with "enter" after failing

Minesweeper: Place (or delete if present) flags with right click, on mac this is a 2 finger press on the trackpad, on all other systems, it is a standard right click. back to main menu with escape after winning or failing

Asteroids: Shoot with spacebar, move with WASD, rotate with left and right arrows: Play another round with "enter" after failing. Note that enemy ships can destroy asteroids for you but you will not receive points for that (+0 will be displayed.) This is not a bug.
